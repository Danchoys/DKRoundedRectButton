A custom UIButton that has the look and feel of the rounded rect buttons, seen in the AppStore along with some other Apple's apps.

This button is marked IB_DESIGNABLE and can be configured from the Interface Builder. When you do so, take note of two things:

1. You need to set the `Type` parameter to `Custom` in the Attributes inspector.
2. If you are using CocoaPods, add the `use_frameworks!` to your PodFile. Note that dynamic frameworks are not available prior to iOS 8.0.

## Requirements

iOS 7.1+

## Installation

DKRoundedRectButton is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "DKRoundedRectButton"
```
